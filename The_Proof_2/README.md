It was a quick meeting. The boss came in to the conference room where Beverly and I had been waiting after we figured out the coincidence with the beacon. He gripped the doorframe and tried to smile at Beverly. 

"So. John Smith had a plane ticket booked all the way through to Izumo Enmusubi Airport. And the location buried in that beacon just happened to be nearby."

"That's right sir," said Beverly cheerfully. She flipped her hair over her ear and smiled.  

"The location actually isn't buried-" I began.

"Not important," my boss interrupted with a wave. "Here's why I called you in. State says they have a complaint. From the Japanese embassy. Seems that the Japanese think someone has been interfering with their satellite links. It just so happens that the funny business was first notiecd in Izumo. Maybe John Smith is part of a team or cell. State says there's been harassment and jamming. They have a copy of the signal. They think it's American in origin. And now we have an American in strange places doing strange things with satellites."

"About the location-" I tried again.

"Yes, the location. I know. It just so happens that there's a site with some very expensive receiving equipment. Something like  Tasha or Tisha."

"Izumo-taisha. The Grand Shrine? The one in Shimane Prefecture?" Beverly said. She sat up a bit straighter and the smiled faded.

"Yeah. State impressed upon me how old and important it is," the boss grumbled. "But it doesn't even have any deer."

"It's not just for tourists," Beverly explained. "It's a very important intelligence site. We did a joint operation there, maybe ten years ago. This could be serious." 

"So, when do we leave?" I asked. They both stared at me. 

"You're not going anywhere," my boss said. "The file is on the server. You've been on a roll lately. See if you can find out anything that ties our John Smith to harassing Japanese intelligence. He's bit off more than he can chew if that's the case here."

A couple hours later, Beverly texted me from the airport. She was on her way to Japan. 

`"Call the service as soon as you find anything. I have concerns."`
