`1) What’s the story on the dated .wav? `

`2) Are these timestamps valid on the beacon files?`

`3) What was the location of the observing station? `

`1) Tip line. Unedited. `

`Party reported having recording gear as a “roving station for a contest”. Some of the gear was “accidentally left on” during air travel. Party reported it through the website. `

`Party lives in Phoenix, AZ, but was visiting family in Canada. NFI.`

`2) Unknown. Copasat/SARSAT portal and database are currently down. They say these are the uplink packets. They’re testing the packetizer and downlink on SARSAT 7 to confirm correct operation.`

`There should be GPS location information in the uplink beacons. It’s not like the old days, where you had to figure out doppler. `

`3) The receiving station ID, for SARSAT ground, came back as invalid. It's not on their list. I don't know what to tell you there. Maybe it's related to their database being down. I'll send it as soon as they get things back online. `
