In order to create the 406 MHz digital beacons, MATLAB and GNU Radio were used. 

MATLAB was used to create the packet contents as close as reasonable according to https://tcmayak.ru/images/docs/CS-T001-JUN-27-2018.pdf

These packet contents were inserted as vectors in GNU Radio flowgraphs.

There is one flowgraph per beacon.
