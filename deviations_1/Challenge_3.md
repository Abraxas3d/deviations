1) Provenance on the dated .wav? 

2) Are these timestamps valid on the beacon files? 

3) What was the location of the observing station?

1) Tip line. Unedited. 

Party reported having recording gear as a “roving station for a contest”. Some of the gear was “accidentally left on” during air travel. Party recognized the beacon and reported it through the website. 

Party lives in Phoenix, AZ, but was visiting family in Canada. NFI.

2) Unknown. Copasat portal and database are currently down. There should be GPS location information in the beacon packet. It’s not like the old days, where you had to figure out doppler.

But, I’ll send the observing station location to you when their database is back up.
