The road had seemed a lot rougher driving back. That should have gotten his attention. Maybe he would have even caught the mistake. But, he had been distracted. 

The cold air and a strange weight on his chest. Broken glass and the smell of antifreeze. There must have been an accident. He must have been in an accident. Had there been an accident? He closed his eyes again, just for a minute. 

When he woke up again, it was colder. 

It didn’t hurt, but everything was heavy. Especially the bag on his chest. He was looking at the stars for a long time before it became obvious to him that perhaps Virgo should not be so clearly visible through the windshield. 

He fumbled around. His arms were heavy. His face was heavy. What was going on with this bag? He had only brought the radio gear, and it was in the back.

Dust swirled in the headlights. It was quiet. No engine. He couldn’t have been here long. He could just pull back on the road. If he could just get the bag off his chest.

That’s when it started to hurt. It started as a dull ache in his hip. It radiated up his side into the ribs, stopping beneath the shoulder blades. Seat belt was still on. He didn’t seem to be cut or bleeding. But, his glasses were gone. He wasn’t real good at seeing close up anymore. Getting old wasn’t for wimps. 

He pushed the bag on his chest. To his great surprise, it turned out to be attached to the steering wheel.

“Holy cow. I’ve been in an accident,” he said. The words were whisked away by the cool dry air. He couldn’t take them back. He had made a truth. And now, he needed to attend to it.

The emergency kit was still in the door pocket. He fished it up and laboriously pulled out the emergency radio beacon, shoving the zipper pull with his thumb as to not irritate the ribs with too much movement. 

He carefully considered whether or not to use it. There were some things that were going to be hard to explain. But, out here, in the middle of nowhere, who would come? Probably some volunteer fire department kid. Maybe a park ranger. He’d suffer only temporary embarrassment. The minor risk of anyone really noticing anything about him was much better than dying of a collapsed lung. 

He turned on the beacon. 

One had to press recessed buttons, twice, on either side of the body of the beacon. It was almost too hard to do. The warning LED was steady red for a while, then flashed a few times and went off. It was transmitting. He closed his eyes again. Just for a minute.
