“What are you still doing here?” my boss said from the doorway.

My office must have been the only soft warm light in a very dark building. The overhead fluorescent lights had been off for hours, the incessant buzzing a distant memory. Everyone else had gone home after the 3pm all-hands meeting.

“Expense reports”, I lied, flinching backwards in the rolling chair. I’d been sitting too long. 

“Well I’m glad you’re here,” he said. 

He had on tennis clothes and was carrying a diet Coke. His badge lanyard refused to cooperate with the sheer audacity of the polo shirt collar. The heavy black strap stuck up in a stubborn standing wave of authority. He must have thrown it on in the car. 

I had never seen his kneecaps before. They had a strange scarred geography. He lifted up a hand and gripped the doorframe, like he always did before delivering some new assignment or the occasional bad news. He cut a completely different silhouette in club togs. If only we were allowed cameras in the building.

“We have a problem.” 

All right, bad news it was. And quite possibly a new assignment.

“You know things about satellites, right?”

Oh, a trick question. I leaned back even further from my desk and crossed my arms. I tried to look somewhat intrigued, but also confused. I wanted to appear as if I knew something about satellites, but not enough to get a huge assignment dumped on me late on a Friday night. 

“Thought so.”

Dammit.

“CopaSat thinks they’ve been hacked. They got what they claim are some bogus beacons from their fancy digital system. We’ve been asked to look into it. I got a call. At the club.”

I pulled myself back up towards my desk. 

“The files are already on the secure server. Just make sure we don’t have one of your little friends from that convention you like to go to messing around with search and rescue, ok?”

“By when?” I asked.

“I did mention I was glad to see you were still here, right?” he said.

“No, you actually-”

“Copasat is very glad you are still here,” he said. And, he left. 

Friday the 13h had struck again.
