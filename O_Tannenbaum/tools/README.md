final.zip is the IQ recording used to solve the challenge. 

Mayan_Countdown.grc creates the IQ file. It uses the .png sent with gr-paint. The image is the Mayan date for 12 May 2016. The spikes represent the date as well, in terms of relative gain. Each spke is one of the Mayan date values. The idea here is that the satellite is providing an ancient version of WWV. It is also clearly non-ballistic in behavior. 

The last civilization to "use" it was the Mayans. It's not clear how they received the signal. 

Mayan_Viewer.grc lets you view the output file. There is no complex modulation or coding here. It's a visual challenge. 

Flag is the Mayan date: 

Flag{13.0.3.7.19}
