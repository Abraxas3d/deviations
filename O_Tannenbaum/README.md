It was a bright and sunny Monday. I was making the rounds at work. I'd farmed out about two dozen somewhat unusual house plants in various offices on site. Their constant need for watering and tending gave me more than enough excuse to walk around and get all the gossip under cover of regular and useful service. I had computer technicians on three whole floors on my route. 

"Good call on sending in search and rescue. He wouldn't have made it much longer," called a familiar voice. 

I turned. It was my boss. I nodded, somewhat embarrassed at the attention in the hallway. It was unusual for my boss to acknowledge anyone outside of meetings. I stood awkwardly, holding an empty watering can and a pair of bonsai trimming scissors.

"Deputy that took over the towing operation found a thumb drive and some really nice directional radio gear in the truck. At least, that's what the manifest said. Seems that the antenna kit and the downconverter are now missing," he said.

He rubbed the side of his hand and studied his suit cuff. Then he gave the scissors I was holding a long hard look.

"Take a look at the contents of that drive. See if there's anything on there that shouldn't be. Seems like our John Smith might not have just been off-roading. Oregon requires a permit to go gallavanting all around Lost Forest Dunes. He had a truck. He had a reservation. No one ever saw him or his truck there and there's no permit for a John Smith. And, how did you get those past security?"

I looked at the scissors.

"Well. It's like this. These here, they’re-"

"Never mind,” he interrupted. “Just don't stab anyone with them."
