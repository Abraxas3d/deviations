"Neutrinos!" I said. 

“Maybe I haven’t heard you right,” Scott said. “Neutrinos don’t have anything to do with whales. There are no whales at the South Pole.”

“Yes, there are,” said Beverly. “They come for the krill.”

“Ok Ms Trivial Pursuit-”

“I was, actually. Miss Trivial Pursuit. 1998,” she said firmly. She had been in a not-amused state all day. The travel budget was now in the red, despite the Amundsen-Scott Station trip happening only in my boss’s mind. She’d said we could have flown fairly close to Antarctica, and that she knew of some really great restaurants in South America. 

“Neutrinos?” I said, trying to get them back on subject. 

“Neutrinos are barely competent communications particles. We’ve only recently been able to get them to work for transmitting data. There is no way some random old dude with some radio gear and a death wish is capturing transmissions beamed from renegade scientists from CERN that irritate whales.”

“What if CERN is a shadow government?” Beverly asked. 

“I think it’s being beamed to the renegade scientists,” I said. “Not from.”

Beverly leaned forward and looked at me directly. So, I looked at her shoes. One of them had a serious scratch in the blue leather. She should really get that repaired. The shoes were in otherwise excellent shape.

“Look, if it’s not from the renegade scientists, then who is it from? Aliens?” 

“Well, I can’t answer that,” I said. “But we are seeing a growing worldwide pattern of strange transmissions with unusual characteristics.” 

She sat back. “Yeah, the transmissions in Japan appeared to originate from non-ballistic orbiting equipment. So were the alleged transmissions from Christmas Valley. There are gaps in what the Air Force has provided. This may not be a prank, Scott. It’s not aliens, but it could be harassment or probing from an enemy.”

“And with a non-cooperative person of interest,” Scott said hooking his fingers in air quotes for the last three words, “We don’t have much choice except to figure out what this means as quickly as possible.”

“Non-cooperative?” I asked.

Beverly began to explain. “Yeah. John Smith woke up. Wanted to know where he was, claimed he got lost off roading, made up some stories about the campground that he never visited. Then he figured out we had his stuff and he stopped talking.”

“What gaps?” Scott asked.

“Gaps? In John Smith’s story?” I said.

“No. Gaps from the Air Force data. What’s that about?” Scott continued. He’d wrinkled up his forehead like he did when he was on to something. 

“Oh,” Beverly said. “They said they had some problems with GPS. The story is that some of the space surveillance data is not reliable. So, they won’t release it.”

Scott pondered a moment. 

“John Smith had GPS problems too. Or, at least his car did. The truck was equipped with GPS. It was off by miles when he crashed. There was a log. Perfect track. Just way off course. Forensics said it was defective. That model was under a recall.”

"No bulletins about GPS in the dailies," Bevery said. "The problem must not be widespread. But it was the first thing my boss said would be a target, it this was some sort of real attack."

“It’s not impossible to interfere with GPS,” I said. “It’s not impossible to create a fake signal. All you have to do is overpower the relatively weak signal from the satellites. But, when you do that, some of the signal characteristics are missing. You can detect naive spoofing.’

“That’s from your new friends at that conference. Where is it this year? San Diego, right?” 

“Yes, I think-” 

“Good luck with the travel expenses,” Beverly grumbled. 

“Oh, I didn’t think of that. But, it’s already approved,” I said. “Besides, it’s not until September. There’s plenty of time.” 

“Well we don’t have plenty of time to rule out man-made interference to your whales,” Scott said. “Are the files on the server? What’s the mission here?”

“Find out if there’s anything to these signals,” I said. "They are repeated at regular intervals. They come in batches of three. We have an example of each type of transmission. And. Well. The communications people claim that they are coming from underneath the ice."
