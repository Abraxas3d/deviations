This is a simple AM transmission.

It has doppler added to the carrier, but that should not prevent receiving it.

The doppler indicates non-ballistic behavior.

Three audio files are transmitted. 

One is a song.

The other two are scrambled versions of the same song.

There are 27 sections of the song. These stand for the 26 letters of the alphabet plus space. 

There are two sentences transmitted this way. 

The .wav file was split up and the message encoded by the wavesplitter python script written by @FirmWarez.
