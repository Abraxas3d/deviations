"Neutrinos?" I asked. Maybe I hadn't heard right.

"Yes. Neutrinos," my boss said. 

"That is really not my area-" I began. My boss waited. I had interrupted myself. He tugged on his suit cuff impatiently, then studied his own thumbnail. He was probably looking for fungus. There had been a breakout of nail fungus in upper management, according to one of my Plant People. 

"It's May," I said, changing tactics. "It is not reasonable to go to the South Pole right now."

"It isn't reasonable to go to the South Pole at any point of the calendar year. But you're going. We have angry scientists, an observatory with interference, and your John Smith, if that is his real name, left breadcrumbs all over the place when he broke into CERN looking for Ice Breaker or Ice Cube or whatever this observatory is called.

He picked imaginary dust particles off his sleeve. The fabric was deep blue with periwinkle pinstripes, not a crease to be seen. 

"Why can't the files be put on the server?" I asked.

"Security!" he said, throwing both arms up in the air.  

"But we have the best sec-"

"I know! I tried!" my boss insisted. "This is the last of your travel budget. After all of you spent so much time in Japan on some math-"

"Japan! I didn't even get to go to Japan! How can my travel budget possibly be exhausted if I didn't even get to go on the trip that allegedly consumed all these funds?"

"See now you're talking like management material," he said nodding. A strange light rose in his eyes.

"No. No. Nope. No sir," I sputtered. "I'll go. I love South America. South Africa. I mean, South Anarctica."

"It's just Anarctica. The South is implied," he said. "And don't worry, I'll have Beverly take care of the plants."

Fortunately, Amundsenâ€“Scott South Pole Station had been closed for the winter since February. I convinced operations to let me take an in-office sabbatical in lieu of travel. The Station had advanced telecommunications support through satellite. There wasn't any problem with the data rates, and the interference was already captured by the one communications engineer that was still on the ice. The recordings had all already been uploaded to CERN. 

The problem was paperwork. The recordings were part of the neutrino work, but they had also interfered with "biological research", which was another division.

Being an expert in organizational dysfunction, I called in a few small favors. 

All I had to do was break into the CERN database for Ice Cube, and surely that would let me see the recordings of interference to the instruments at the South Pole. 

How hard could it be?
