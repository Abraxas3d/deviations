"In that case, we are going to need your help. There's a sensitive issue."

I waited. 

"Are you still there?"

"Oh, yes. I was just-"

"The location of the beacon is close enough to a European Space Agency facility to escalate an inquiry. One of their administrators found this cryptic message printed out on an old Teletype Model 28 ASR. I'll have it sent to you by courier, but just write it down now. It's not that long."

"The damn thing just keeps printing. Even when it's turned off. We have someone cooperating on site who reports the same interference from Japan, and now this. What could it mean? My contact there thinks it's evidence of weaponized microwaves. Some of the scientists are reporting severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, the whole deal. They're blaming Russia right now, but that migt not last."

I looked at the letters. This had to just be noise. Something induced on an old electromechanical device. It wasn't interesting. Similar interference to Japan would be interesting. 

"Well, I can try and take a look but I'd really rather-"

"We need to know what this means," the voice on the phone said. "John Smith visited Madrid last year. And he had another ticket booked. It wasn't to Madrid, but he had quite a long layover in Madrid. We need to get a handle on what is going on here, especially after what happened in Japan."

"What happened in-"

"I have to go. I'll work things out with your boss. Are you cleared for travel?"

"Travel?"

Mentioning the Model 28 ASR to put the player on the track of Baudot
(the Model 28 was a Baudot machine) and paper tape (ASR means it had
a paper tape reader/punch)

Here's a Baudot paper tape reference chart:

Decoding manually. Start with the cryptic message and replace each letter
with a picture of the paper tape column for that character:
