I was on the third floor watering the False Julip when Beverly walked up to me.  

"Just the person I was looking for."

She looked down at a sheet covered in lime green post-it notes.

"Those beacons you were working on. What was the location in FridayNight1? Our perp bought a bunch of airline tickets. If we can tie the tampering of the signal to travel plans, then maybe we can get a win here."

"Our perp?" I asked, setting down the watering can.

"Yeah. John Smith. Or whoever he is. His passport was a very nice forgery."

"No interviews?"

"Not if he manages to die on us first. He was out of surgery but not conscious as of a few hours ago. It would be great to have him in cuffs when he wakes up. Mess with our satellites, get the beam."

What is the general location in the FridayNight1 beacon files?
