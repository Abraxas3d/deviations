In the course of my work, I have had reasons to call the State Department. But, I had never gotten more than maybe one call every three or four months. 

On Tuesday I received fourteen.  Most of them were about Japan. But the last one was about another beacon. 

"Good afternoon. I hear you're the one to speak with about the suspicious beacon locations."

"Well, yes, for the most part, you could say that-"

"Excellent. I'll get right to the point. What is the general location of beacon number 5?"
